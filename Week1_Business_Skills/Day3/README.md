# Day 3
## Critical Thinking & Debating 
### Objectives
- To understand what critical thinking is 
- To developed techniques for thinking, reading and writing critically
- To understand the formal structure 
- Some others


### Why is it important? 
- Helps you to create strong srguments by justrifying your claims with evidence you gathered and evaluated
- Can contribute to any role as it requires the ability to gather information, analyse it and evaluate it

### Critical Thinking Skills
- Actively seeing out all sides of an argument
- Checking the facts and evidence
- Responding objectively

### Level of intellectual Skill
Thinking triangle - Benjamin Blooms 

- `From top` Evaluate - Make judgements about the value of info
- Synthesise - Combine information or ideas into something new
- Analyse - Make a methodical and detailed examination of something
- Apply - Use knowledge
- Understand - Have understanding
- Remember - Be aware of something, recall information

(You want to use all of the steps of the triangle)

### 3 steps of the Critical Thinking Process

- Identify - identify the problem/main points of the argument, identify the claims being made, identify the evidence 
used and the conclusions reached. I.e. base your arguments on evidence that you gathered

- Analyse by asking the following: does the info make sense in relation to other research. How old is the material? Is the material
clear or do you need to find additional info to aid understanding. Does the argument present a balanced view or are some
topics disregarded. 

- Apply and compare, look out for: The implications of other information. Weaknesses when an applied to a real-life situation. 
A lack of coverage.

### 3 modes of thinking

- Divergent (Imagination) - questions lead to ideas
- Convergent (logic) - facts lead to answers
- Lateral - uses both - i.e. always do!!!!
 
e.g. use imagination to propose an idea, then use logic where you provide facts to solve a problem or answer a question
- Netflix lost database in 2009 as they had data in localhost (shutdown for 3 days, only time they were shutdown), decided to put 
all data on the cloud, took them a long time, but now they are extremely successful and saved a lot of money.
 
### 6 thinking hats again - IMPORTANT

- Developed as a parallel thinking process which enables people to redirect their thoughts into different areas i.e. hats
- Each represents a different factor or criteria of thinking
-- White - Information needed
-- Yellow - Brightness, optimism
-- Black - Judgement, critical thinking
-- Red - Emotions and feelings
-- Green - Creativity, an opportunity to express new concepts etc.
-- Blue - Thinking, its the control system that ensures all hats are utilised where needed

### Incorrect Attitudes
Neither of these ways of thinking are correct and will prevent you from embracing critical thinking with an open and objective mind

- Ignorant Certainty - The belief that there are definite answers to all questions e.g. overly optimistic person
- Naive Relativism - The beliefe that there is no truth and all agruments are equal e.g. Most of the time, there is a truth

### What is Enquiry-Based Learning?
Example. 17 in the class, after the class 1 came to trainer, he said that someone else was rude to me and dont put me in the same 
group as that person. Trainers job is to listen, take the info and calm him down, ask him "What happened? What did he say to you
to make you feel like that?" Once I have the info, I enquired about the incident, and decided to find out the other side of the
story. I haven't decided anything, I chose to enquire what happened instead of jumping to conclusions. Enquire enquire enquire, 
ask both what happened and the only way to truly find out what happened, you need to ask around to find out what happened. Assess
the situation before jumping to any conclusions.

- The Enquiry Cycle - Reflect - Enquire - Investigate - Create - Dicuss - Reflect - Enquire....

What questions might we ask when thinking critically? - e.g. What is the source of evidence?

Things to consider:
- What is the source of evidence? 
- What are the kinds of claims being made?
- Where is the evidence of these claims?
- What are the Strengths and Weaknesses?
- How clear are the points?
- Is it a balanced argument? 
- Are there underlying themes?
- Are the examples good? (Is the evidence good enough for me to take action)
- Are there difference or similarities to other situations?

Examples of graphs - Media exaggerates numbers to manipulate and MISLEAD people to make them think things are much worse 
than they actually are. LIES

3 different examples where the news MISLEADS people about statistics - CRITICALLY think about the data and decide whether it is true.

### Arguments and Debating

What is an argument?: - Difference of opinions

- Claim - Present your argument in a clear statement
- Evidence - Present the evidence to support your claim
- Impact - Explain the significance of the evidence i.e. how does it support your claim?

To form a judgement on the validity of another party's argument 

- Consider the following: 
-- Do the claims make logical sense? 
-- Are the claims based on opinion or supported with evidence?
-- Are any assumption made? 
-- Have all alternatives been considered?

Supporting evidence, consider the following:
- Does the evidence support all claims made?
- Is the evidence appopriate for the topic?
- Is the evidence recent?
- Does the evidence conflict or completent other evidence?
- Where does the evidence come from

`Quality of evidence = Quality of Data + Quality of Interpretation` 

### What if we want to challenge the argument?

Debating Etiquette
- Acknowledge the other person's view before challenging it
- Be constructive rather than simply dismissing the other peron's point of view
- Reflect on the strengths of the other person's argument
- Think about your language and whether you risk being offensive before you speak

Objective Phrasing

Do say
- It can be argued that
- Tends to
- There is evidence to suggest that...
- It has been said that....

Don't Say
- I...
- I think that...
- `MISSED SOME HERE`

### `All fallacies are on Discord` Logical Fallacies (Issues/Problems with the opposing sides arguments) to look for 

- False dichotomy - where the speaker forces the debate into two sides, though there are more options available
E.g. When a colleague tells the team to decide between two new HR tools but you have heard of a cheaper and more efficient 
tool online which you think would be more fit for purpose - Have they considered alternatives
- Assertion - When the speaker presents a statement as fact which appears invalid of may be an assumption
E.g. When a colleague states that because we doubled profits this year we will do so again next year? Do they know that for sure?
- Morally flawed - Arguments which go against the code of ethics and morals
- Correlation rather than causation - When a speaker suggests a link between two events suggesting one lead to the other but 
without sufficient evidence
- Failure to deliver promises - A speak might fail to complete a task they promised to deliver
- Straw man - The speaker may intentionally introduce an argument against them and rebut it to strenghthen their position
- Contradiction - A speakers argument may contradict their previous argument and reduce their credibility.
E.g. When a colleague presents evidence showing only positive responses from a satisfaction survey but these contradict the 
complaints they previously showed
- Compare the conclusion to reality - Consider what would happen if the motion became reality, which usually reveals that 
its more complicated and problematic than the speaker suggested
