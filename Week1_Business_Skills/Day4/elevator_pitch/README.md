# Elevator Pitch Attempt 

Hi my name is Matt, this past summer I graduated as a master of chemistry from the university of bath. Throughout the course, I
gained some experience with Python and coding in select units and as I was approaching the end of the course, I found that I 
wanted to pursue working in software instead as a potential future career. To cement my passion, in the following months after my
graduation I decided to further improve my skills in coding by completing courses in web design on freecode camp as well as practice
code in languages like javascript. When I began my research into the different roles available to me in the tech industry,
I discovered DevOps which I found to be one of the most interesting roles I could pursue. The role stood out for me as I felt that
could not only develop my skills in software development but also gain deeper knowledge in operations further broadening my skillset.
Furthermore the role would allow me to work at the forefront of the tech industry as it is still a relatively novel role and the fact 
that the role is in such high demand further attracted me to it. I found these factors to be incredibly exciting and also I felt 
that being at the forefront of software technology would be a perfect fit for me.
