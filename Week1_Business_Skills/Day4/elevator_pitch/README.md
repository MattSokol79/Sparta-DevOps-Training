# Elevator Pitch Attempt 

Hi my name is Matt, this past summer I graduated as a master of chemistry from the university of bath. Throughout the course, I
gained some experience with Python and coding in select units and as I was approaching the end of the course, I decided that I would
much rather pursue coding and working in software as a potential future career. To cement this, in the following months after my
graduation I decided to further improve my skills in coding by completing courses in web design on freecode camp as well as practice
code in languages like javascript. When I began my research into the different roles available to me in the tech industry,
I discovered DevOps which I found to be one of the most interesting roles I could pursue. The role stood out for me as I felt that
could not only develop my skills in software development but also gain deeper knowledge into operations broadening my skillset.
I also found that personally I wanted to pursue a profession which is still relatively novel as well as being high in demand.
I found these factors to be incredibly exciting and also I felt that being at the forefront of software technology would be a
perfect career for me.
