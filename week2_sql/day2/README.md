# Day 2 - Querying an SQL Database
## Objectives
- Demonstrate the ability to connect to a database and query it
- Write simple SQL statements to alter and add data
- Write simple queries to extract and compare data
- Demonstrate an ability to research and learn technical skills independently

## SELECT

![](select.PNG)

**Logical Syntax Sequence**
- SELECT 
- DISTINCT
- FROM 
- WHERE
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- ORDER BY

**Processing Sequence**
- FROM
- WHERE
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- SELECT
- DISTINCT
- ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
```
- An Asterisk * means to select all columns
i.e. SELECT all columns FROM the table

### WHERE
We can better define what we want with the WHERE clause
- WHERE is used to filter the data 

**Example from Northwind database**
```sql
SELECT ContactName, Fax, CompanyName, City FROM Customers WHERE City = 'London';
```

- City is the column
- The = symbol is the operator
- 'London' is the comparator

To create a valid WHERE clause you need to make sure each data type you request is formatted properly APOSTROPHES!!!!

### DISTINCT
SOME CODE MISSING HERE

### COUNT
**To count the number of rows in the constraint, type `COUNT(*)` as shown below**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'France';
```

### TOP
**Can select only the top number of values as shown below:

```sql
SELECT TOP 100 CompanyName, City FROM Customers WHERE City = 'Paris'
```

### AND
**AND keyword is a powerful tool as seen below - it forces it follow both rules**
```sql
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice FROM Products WHERE CategoryID = 1 AND Discontinued = '0'
```
### OR
**Can use OR to get out info when either side are true**

### Other operators
- <> Or != not equal to
- < Less than
- > More than
- <= Less than or equal to
- >= Greater than or equal to
These work with numbers, but do they work with letters?
